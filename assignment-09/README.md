Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?
A universal selector type is when you select all elements on the page and give it all the same style elements. Element type selector refers to all elements with the same name will all look the same such as h1 or ul. Class selector type is when you use a dot then in that class you described a style that will just be used in that class. ID selector type is when you use a # that is described by the developer of the page
and is set with a certain element on the page. You would decide what kind of selector type based on what your trying to do on the page I suppose.
If you are trying to style the whole page in one way or if you are trying to style just on specific element on the page.

Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
During this assignment I struggled to position the blocks how I wished to place them. It took me a long time
to figure this out. I also struggled with how to even envision how I would like the page to look. In the end
I was happy with the look.
