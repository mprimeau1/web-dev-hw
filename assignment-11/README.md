Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
This is a terrible assignment. I don't understand what I am even suppose to do really. Hope that is was enough. Maybe one week I will get a grade for this class.
Every week there has been a walkthrough video to help start the assignment and this week there wasn't.
