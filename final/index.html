      <div class="text"><p>Welcome! We are a traveling couple that has traveled all over the world to over 40 countries together.
        Follow us as we discover the world and it has to offer. Our mission is to inspire the people we know and love and to learn more
      about cultures around the world. </p>


      <p> We are inspired to travel for many reasons but the things we love to see and experience always include a few staples such as food, literature, history and architechure.
        We often travel by car or van but would love to explore more options for traveling such as canal boating and sailing.</p>
