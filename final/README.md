## Mary Primeau

Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?
I learned in web development that using GitHub is a very useful tool for sharing information.


Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?
I learned new things like how to input images and video into a webpage. I also enjoyed learning
more about fonts and how to use them.


Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
For this assignment I used my past experiences to make a website for a traveling vlogging or blogging site.
There are many travel influencers and that was what I was trying to do for myself. I created a logo and edited
my own personal photos to create the website. It took me a lot of trial and error to figure out the perfect web safe colors
that photoshop wouldn't let me use. In the end I tried to make the site and images seem to flow together. I went over a few assignments from the year and used
them for inspiration for my final site. I tried to use a simple color scheme and a easy to read font. I didn't want the site to look tacky.
