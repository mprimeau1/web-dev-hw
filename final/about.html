      <h2> <img src="./images/icon_3.jpg"/>About Us!</h2>

      <div class="text"><p>It all started in 2008 in a classic setting, a house party. Mary was a 20 year old young girl in her home town looking for friends to explore the world with no direction. Jason was 25 who just came back from Ireland and 20 various countries. We meet at a mutual friend's house that was throwing a keg party. Near the 4 a.m mark Jason had gathered twenty people to tell tales of his worldly travels. Six months later and we had traveled from New York to Hawaii, California and back to New York. This was just the start.</p> </div>
