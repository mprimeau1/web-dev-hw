# Assignment 10
## Mary Primeau

Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?
I imagined that my client was for a lodge. The owners wanted a simple site that
would describe who the owners were and what kind of place that the lodge is.


What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block?

Block is an element that always starts on a new line. Inline elements do not start on a new line, they can be in the same line.
Inline block is just like inline elements but they have sides to them.



Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
During this assignment I stylized a navigation menu bar and imputed images for a fake client.
It took me a while to find place holder images for the client and what kind of color pallet to go with.
I went with a autumn theme because I thought it would represent the outdoors. I struggled to build the navigation bar
but in the end was happy with the results.
