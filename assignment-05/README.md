How many main document <head> and <body> elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play?

In a main document a page can only have one <head> and one <body>. A <head> is where the
behind the scenes elements of the webpage lives. This is were meta data, viewport, title, link and style are kept. The <body> of the page is where what you visually see on the page, the bulk of the page. They are different in what you visually see written and what
you don't see written but how the style of the page looks.


Describe the difference between structural and semantic markup.
A structural markup is information that is an element that is the document like headings, paragraphs, breaks and lists. A semantic markup is a stylization on a written text, such as using bold, italics, or subscripts.


Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
For this assignment I used a recipe that I found on the internet. I have actually made this recipe before and thought it tasted great.
During the process of this weeks assignment I found it very interesting to learn structural details of how a webpage is made. Subscripts and super-scripts and vert interesting to me,
I have always wondered how that was done in HTML. Also how to create more links such as how to use the mailto: was cool.
