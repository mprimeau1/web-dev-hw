What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?
A system font is a family of raster fonts that are commonly found on computers, this is a fall back system. A web font is a type of font that is set to each web page browser. A web-safe font is a type of font that is a safe bet that it is installed on a computer and can be displayed in webpages.


What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?
The importance of having a fallback font is so that if the font fails to load properly
then another font that is super similar to that will be in its place.
