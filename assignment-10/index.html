      <h1>The Yellow Paint</h1>
      <h2>Robert Louis Stevenson</h2>

      <div class="text">
        <p>In a certain city there lived a physician who sold yellow paint.
          This was of so singular a virtue that whoso was bedaubed with it
          from head to heel was set free from the dangers of life, and the
           bondage of sin, and the fear of death for ever. So the physician
           said in his prospectus; and so said all the citizens in the city;
           and there was nothing more urgent in men's hearts than to be
           properly painted themselves, and nothing they took more delight in
           than to see others painted. There was in the same city a young man
           of a very good family but of a somewhat reckless life, who had
           reached the age of manhood, and would have nothing to say to the
           paint: "Tomorrow was soon enough," said he; and when the morrow
           came he would still put it off. She might have continued to do
           until his death; only, he had a friend of about his own age and much
            of his own manners; and this youth, taking a walk in the public
             street, with not one fleck of paint upon his body, was suddenly
             run down by a water-cart and cut off in the heyday of his
             nakedness. This shook the other to the soul; so that I never
             beheld a man more earnest to be painted; and on the very same
             evening, in the presence of all his family, to appropriate music,
             and himself weeping aloud, he received three complete coats and a
             touch of varnish on the top. The physician (who was himself
             affected even to tears) protested he had never done a job
             so thorough.
        </p>
        <p>Some two months afterwards, the young man was carried on a stretcher
          to the physician's house.
          </p>
        <p>"What is the meaning of this?" he cried, as soon as the door was
          opened. "I was to be set free from all the dangers of life; and here
          have I been run down by that self-same water-cart, and my leg is
          broken."
          </p>
        <p>     "Dear me!" said the physician. "This is very sad. But I perceive
           I must explain to you the action of my paint. A broken bone is a
           mighty small affair at the worst of it; and it belongs to a class of
           accident to which my paint is quite inapplicable. Sin, my dear young
           friend, sin is the sole calamity that a wise man should apprehend;
           it is against sin that I have fitted you out; and when you come to
           be tempted, you will give me news of my paint."
          </p>
