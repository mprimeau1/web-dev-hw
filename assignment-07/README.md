Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
For this weeks assignment I struggled to find an embed link for the audio section of my website.
Soundclound did not provide a link and I refuse to buy a $12 a month subscription to
a random website. I felt like everything else went smoothly. I learned lots about embeding video and audio onto a webpage.
