# Assignment 08
## Mary Primeau

Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?
I have never taken an HTML class before but have had a little exposure to it. I learned many new things like how to
add video and audio easily into a webpage. Another thing I learned was how to create tables and forms, I can see how this will be useful in the future.


Next module we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?
I am excited to learn more about CSS, I have had a more exposure to this style of coding. I look forward to learning more about how to
create and style a webpage.


Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
During this weeks assignment I created a recipe website with three pages. I am a chef full time as well as being a student
so it was kind of cool to mix the two worlds. I struggled with finding the right positioning of all the elements on the page, I felt like I
could never make it look right, so in the end I decided simple is best.
