## Assignment 06

Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do the serve?
I have come across a few forms in the past while on the web. One that comes to mind is
recently on the USPS website I had to write a form to them complaining about lost mail.
I think that the purpose of forms is to write several sentences to the webmaster to
comment or complain about something to do with there business.


List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and where they might be used.
Different types of input buttons are used all over the web. I see them mainly when I want to
subscribe to something new, like a wine box club or food delivery service. An example of text
is when you go to a website that sells alcohol and you have to enter your birth year to
enter the site. Selection may be used when filling out a questionnaire form about when
selecting a new type of product from a website such as makeup or wine.

Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
For this weeks assignment I struggled to figure out what I really wanted to even do
for this assignment. The idea of making forms and tables I can see the benefit of it,
but it was hard for me to come up with a concept of what I should do. Once I started
doing the assignment and started stylizing the content of the table I began to understand
more about the importance of why you would need this on a website.
